    "There may also be times when you want join additonal attributes to your dataset. For example, we have cat specific attributes in the Pet Cats United Kingdom-reference-data.csv file. Let's read that file in as well and then join the animal-life-stage column to our dataset, so we can investigate age in relation to our other attributes. To do this, we will use the `.merge()` method with the following syntax `dataframe.merge(other_dataframe)`. Although not required, it is also good practice to specify which column(s) you're performing the join on by using the `on` parameter and how you would like the join performed by using the `how` parameter.  More information on the merge function can be found here: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/merging.html\n"
